   Define an OCaml record type to represent student names and GPAs. It should be possible to mutate the value of a student’s GPA. Write an expression defining a student with name "Alice" and GPA 3.7. Then write an expression to mutate Alice’s GPA to 4.0.*)


type student = {name: string; mutable gpa: float}
 let alice = {name = "Alice"; gpa = 3.7}
let () = alice.gpa <- 4.0

   Give OCaml expressions that have the following types. Use utop to check your answers.
bool ref
int list ref
int ref list*)
let (_ : bool ref) = ref false
 let (_ : int list ref) = ref [6;8]
 let (_ : int ref list) = [ref 2; ref 8]

    - : int list ref = {contents = [6; 8]}
    - : int ref list = [{contents = 2}; {contents = 8}]*)

   Define a reference to a function as follows:
let inc = ref (fun x -> x + 1)
Write code that uses inc to produce the value 3110.
*)


let inc = ref (fun x -> x + 1)
let exercise =
  let inc = ref (fun x -> x + 1) in
  !inc 3109

   The C language and many languages derived from it, such as Java, has an addition assignment operator written a += b and meaning a = a + b. Implement such an operator in OCaml; its type should be int ref -> int -> unit. Here’s some code to get you started:
let ( +:= ) x y = ...*)
let (+:=) x y =
x := !x + y
let x = ref 5;;
 x +:= 3;;
!x;

(*output: int = 8*)

(*chap7.5
   Define x, y, and z as follows:

let x = ref 0
let y = x
let z = ref 0
Predict the value of the following series of expressions:

# x == y;;
# x == z;;
# x = y;;
# x = z;;
# x := 1;;
# x = y;;
# x = z;;

let _ =

  let y = x in
  let z = ref 0 in
  assert (x == y);
   assert (not (x == z));
   assert (x = y);
   assert (x = z);
   x := 1;
   assert (x = y);
   assert (not (x = z));;




  (*output:x == y will be true.
x == z will be false.
x = y will be true.
x = z will be true.
x := 1 will update the value of x to 1.

   The Euclidean norm of an n
-dimensional vector x=(x1,…,xn)
 is written |x|
 and is defined to be

x21+⋯+x2n−−−−−−−−−−√.
Write a function norm : vector -> float that computes the Euclidean norm of a vector, where vector is defined as follows:

(* AF: the float array [| x1; ...; xn |] represents the
 *     vector (x1, ..., xn)
 * RI: the array is non-empty *)
type vector = float array
Your function should not mutate the input array. Hint: although your first instinct might be to reach for a loop, instead try to use Array.map and Array.fold_left or Array.fold_right.*)

type vector = float array
let norm v =
  sqrt (Array.fold_left (fun acc x -> acc +. x ** 2.) 0. v)
  let norm' v =
   v
   |> Array.map (fun x -> x ** 2.)  (* square each element *)
   |> Array.fold_left (+.) 0.       (* sum all elements *)
   |> sqrt
(*output:type vector = float array
val norm : float array -> float = <fun>
val norm' : float array -> float = <fun>*)

(*chap7.7
   Every vector can be normalized by dividing each component by |x|
; this yields a vector with norm 1:

(x1|x|,…,xn|x|)
Write a function normalize : vector -> unit that normalizes a vector “in place” by mutating the input array. Here’s a sample usage:

# let a = [|1.; 1.|];;
val a : float array = [|1.; 1.|]

# normalize a;;
- : unit = ()

# a;;
- : float array = [|0.7071...; 0.7071...|]
Hint: Array.iteri.*)

let normalize v =
  let n = norm v in 
  Array.iteri (fun i x -> v.(i) <- x /. n) v
  (*output:
     val normalize : float array -> unit = <fun>*)
  
(*chap7.8
   Modify your implementation of norm to use a loop. Here is pseudocode for what you should do:

initialize norm to 0.0
loop through array
  add to norm the square of the current array component
return sqrt of norm*)     
let norm_loop v =
  let n = ref 0.0 in
  for i = 0 to Array.length v - 1 do
    n := !n +. (v.(i) ** 2.)
  done;
  sqrt !n
  (*output:val norm_loop : float array -> float = <fun>*)

  (*chap7.9
     Modify your implementation of normalize to use a loop.*)

     let fact_loop n =
      let ans = ref 1 in
      for i = 1 to n do
        ans := !ans * i
      done;
      !ans
      (*output:val fact_loop : int -> int = <fun>*)
 (*chap7.10
    The Array module contains two functions for creating an array: make and init. make creates an array and fills it with a default value, while init creates an array and uses a provided function to fill it in. The library also contains a function make_matrix for creating a two-dimensional array, but it does not contain an analogous init_matrix to create a matrix using a function for initialization.

Write a function init_matrix : int -> int -> (int -> int -> 'a) -> 'a array array such that init_matrix n o f creates and returns an n by o matrix m with m.(i).(j) = f i j for all i and j in bounds.

See the documentation for make_matrix for more information on the representation of matrices as arrays.*)     
   
let init_matrix n o f =
  Array.init n (fun i -> Array.init o (fun j -> f i j))
  (*output:
     val init_matrix : int -> int -> (int -> int -> 'a) -> 'a array array = <fun>*)
